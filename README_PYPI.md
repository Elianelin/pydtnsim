# PyDTNsim

## Introduction

This python module contains a simulation environment that allows the simulation of arbitrary Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) scenarios on a packet (DTN terminology: bundle) level. *PyDTNsim* provides users with the ability to evaluate the performance of various routing approaches and to detect possibly occurring overload situations. Currently, the focus lies on deterministic Contact-Graph-based routing approaches, but there might be other
approaches available in the future. The clear modularization allows users to easily implement routing approaches on their own.
